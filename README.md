# EngineTester
System for testing binary executables (engines) on sets of data


Problem:
- engines (binaries) work on data (protobuf-generated data packages)
- engines need to be tested
- some previous (or slow) engines provide reference results
- whole structure moves forward as work on engines progresses, and data evolve
